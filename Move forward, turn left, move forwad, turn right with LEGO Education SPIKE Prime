motor_pair.set_motor_rotation(17.6, 'cm') # Set the distance that the robot travels for one rotation of its wheels. The value 17.6 comes from
                                        # the diameter of the wheel (5.6cm) multiplied by "π" (3.14).

motor_pair.move(8.8,'cm', -100, 50) # Start moving for 8.8cm with steering '-100' at 50% of the maximum speed. This makes the robot turn left 90deg
                                    # at 50% of the maximum speed of the motors. The value 8.8 represents the angle of rotation. This is the distance every 
                                    # wheel needs to travel to rotate the robot 90deg. This value is calculated in the following way: The wheel base
                                    # (the distance between the points where the wheels touch the ground) is the
                                    # diameter of the turn (in this case it is 11,2cm). Since we want to turn 90deg (1/4 of the turn) we multiply
                                    # the diameter (11,2) by "π" (3.14) and divide it to 4 as 90 degrees are 1/4 of the circle.
motor_pair.move(40,'cm', 0, 50) # Start moving for 50cm with NO Steering '0' at 50% of the maximum speed.
motor_pair.move(8.8,'cm', 100, 50) # Start moving for 8.8cm with steering '100' at -50% of the maximum speed. This makes the robot turn right 90deg
                                    # at 50% of the maximum speed of the motors. Turn right because the steering is positive 100%.
