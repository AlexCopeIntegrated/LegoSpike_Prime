# LEGO Spike Prime Test Scripts

Welcome to the **LEGO Spike Prime Test Scripts** repository!  
This repository is a personal learning space for experimenting with code written for the LEGO Spike Prime robotics platform.

## 📘 Purpose

The main goal of this repository is to:
- Explore and learn how to program the LEGO Spike Prime Hub using Python (MicroPython).
- Test various motors, sensors, and configuration scripts.
- Prototype small robotics functions like movement, line following, and obstacle avoidance.
- Build confidence with the SPIKE Prime environment and APIs.

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

> **This repository is intended for learning and experimentation only.**  
> Scripts may be incomplete, unstable, or specific to my own hardware setup. Please use with care if adapting for your own projects.

## 📁 Structure

- `scripts/`: Test scripts for motors, sensors, and movements.
- `experiments/`: Larger code experiments or multi-step projects.
- `docs/`: Notes and links to documentation.

## 💡 Getting Started

1. Install the LEGO SPIKE App or use the SPIKE Prime Python Editor.
2. Connect your hub via USB or Bluetooth.
3. Upload test scripts to the hub and run them.
4. Modify and experiment freely!
